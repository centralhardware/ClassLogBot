This was never really intended to be an open-source project.  
But I don’t see any point in keeping the source code private — there’s nothing here worth hiding.  
So, here it is.

The project is a simple tool for managing students and lessons in a tutoring center.  
It’s not built as a product, more like a working utility.

If you find anything interesting, feel free to open an [Issue](../../issues).  
I’ll be glad to hear your questions, suggestions, or feedback.
